# Particle Tycoon Game

A physics-based tycoon game where you place planets to collect particles and earn money!

## How to Play

1. **Objective**: Collect particles by placing planets that attract them with gravity
2. **Particle Emitter**: The red circle in the center spawns particles continuously
3. **Planets**: Blue circles that attract particles with realistic gravity physics
4. **Money**: Earn $1 for each particle that hits a planet
5. **Upgrades**: Spend money to buy more planets and increase particle spawn rate

## Controls

- **Buy Planet**: Click the green "Buy Planet" button, then click anywhere to place a planet
- **Select Planet**: Click on any placed planet to select it (yellow highlight appears)
- **Upgrade Gravity**: Select a planet, then click "Upgrade Gravity" to increase its gravitational pull
- **Upgrade Spawn Rate**: Click the "Upgrade Spawn" button to increase particles per second
- **Test Money**: Click the yellow "Test +$100" button for quick money (testing purposes)
- **Volume Control**: Drag the volume slider to adjust audio levels
- **ESC**: Cancel planet placement or deselect planets

## Game Mechanics

- **Gravity Physics**: Particles are attracted to planets based on realistic gravity simulation
- **Planet Placement**: Planets cannot be placed too close to the emitter or other planets
- **Progressive Costs**: Planet and upgrade costs increase as you buy more
- **Real-time Stats**: Track your money, particles collected, and active particles

## Installation & Running

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # If pip is in PATH:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # If you need to use full Python path (like on your system):
   C:\Python313\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   # If python is in PATH:
   python particle_tycoon.py
   
   # If you need to use full Python path:
   C:\Python313\python.exe particle_tycoon.py
   ```
