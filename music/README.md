# Music folder

This folder contains background music tracks for the Particle Tycoon game.

## Included Tracks

- `deep_space.wav` - Deep ambient space atmosphere
- `cosmic_drift.wav` - Floating through the cosmos
- `stellar_winds.wav` - Solar wind ambience
- `nebula_dreams.wav` - Ethereal nebula soundscape

## Adding Your Own Music

You can add your own music files to this folder. Supported formats:
- `.wav` files (recommended)
- `.ogg` files
- `.mp3` files (if pygame supports it on your system)

### Guidelines for Custom Music

1. **File naming**: Use descriptive names without spaces (use underscores instead)
2. **Volume**: Keep music at a reasonable volume level - the game has volume controls
3. **Length**: Tracks should ideally be 30+ seconds for good looping
4. **Style**: Ambient/background music works best to not distract from gameplay

### Examples of good filenames:
- `my_space_track.wav`
- `ambient_music_01.ogg`
- `custom_background.wav`

The game will automatically detect all supported music files in this folder and add them to the music selection menu.
